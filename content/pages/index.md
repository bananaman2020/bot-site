        subtitle: Part-Time Irish Dev
        content: >
          I Dev in many areas such as front end web development to server side
          Node.JS applications and everything in between.


          I recently started hosting Discord Bots on a small general server in
          the UK. This bot is popular amongst my friends and servers due to the
          recent shutdown of other music bots. The music bot is online 24/7 and
          the Minecraft server bot is also hosted on a general purpose server in
          the UK


          I hope you enjoy my few hours of productivity here and there.
